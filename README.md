# FeatherWing
A bare bones Feather Wing project for Kicad, with verified placement of headers and mounting holes. Based on the Feather specification https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/feather-specification

Use this as a starting point for creating your own Feather compatible Wings. Big thanks to Adafruit for making the Feather format!

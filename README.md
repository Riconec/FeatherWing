# FeatherWing
A bare bones Feather Wing project for Kicad, with verified placement of headers and mounting holes. Based on the Feather specification https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/feather-specification. 

Use this as a starting point for creating your own Feather compatible Wings. Big thanks to Adafruit for making the Feather format! I've used this project to setup my Feather NeoPixel Wing https://github.com/jenschr/NeoPixelWing/

Please note: The Project is in Kicad 5 format. If you still use kicad 4 - I highly recommend swapping! V5 is better than V4 in so many ways.
